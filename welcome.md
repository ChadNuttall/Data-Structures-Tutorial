# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial.  Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Stack](stack.md)
- [Linked List](linked_list.md)
- [Tree](tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
